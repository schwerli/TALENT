Core Components
====================================

This section contains the core infrastructure components of TALENT that provide the foundation for all TALENT functionality. These components work together to provide a consistent and robust framework for tabular machine learning.

The core components are organized into three main categories:

**Essential Infrastructure:**

- **Utils**: Essential utilities for training, evaluation, configuration management, and system operations
- **Data**: Comprehensive data loading, preprocessing, transformation, and handling capabilities  
- **Method Base**: The foundational base class that all model implementations inherit from, providing unified interfaces

**Key Features:**

* **Unified Interface**: All components follow consistent APIs and patterns
* **Extensibility**: Easy to extend and customize for specific use cases
* **Robustness**: Comprehensive error handling and validation
* **Performance**: Optimized for efficiency in tabular data processing
* **Reproducibility**: Built-in support for deterministic operations

**Component Interactions:**

The core components are designed to work seamlessly together:

1. **Data Component** handles all data-related operations (loading, preprocessing, validation)
2. **Utils Component** provides supporting utilities (metrics, configuration, device management)
3. **Method Base** orchestrates the entire training/evaluation pipeline using Data and Utils

**Design Principles:**

* **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has well-defined responsibilities
* **Composition over Inheritance**: Components are composed rather than deeply inherited
* **Configuration-Driven**: Behavior is controlled through configuration rather than code changes
* **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type annotations and validation
* **Performance Optimization**: Efficient memory usage and computational patterns
